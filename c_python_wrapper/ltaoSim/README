****************************************
LTAO Simulation generated.  This does a tomographic reconstruction on 1 DMs, and then projects the correction on-axis.

To run in ltaoSim/, use (for MPI versions, adjust accordingly):
python ltaoPoke.py params.py --param="this.tomoRecon.abortAfterPoke=1;this.tomoRecon.reconmxFilename='rmxTomo.fits'" --init="ndm=1"
python projection.py 1
python ltao.py params.py

Or, more simply:
sh run.sh

Some notes about this simulation:
It will first of all take an interaction matrix.
This will then be inverted to give a control matrix, using a simple SVD.
This will then be projected along the on-axis line of sight, to give the LTAO
reconstruction matrix.
This least-squares wavefront reconstructor will then be used for AO correction.

The LGS tip-tilt signal is assumed valid, i.e. is used.  

Several improvements are possible (left as an excercise for the user):
Minimum variance wavefront reconstruction from the interaction matrix.
Ignore the LGS tip-tilt signal, in the user-generated control matrix.
Model-based reconstruction (e.g. FrIM, FEWHA, etc)

Once you have a suitable reconstruction matrix, you do not need to rerun the
poking or projection parts.
